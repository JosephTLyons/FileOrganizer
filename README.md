# FileOrganizer
A Python script that generates folders based on the extension names of the files
in the current working directory, then sorts all files into these folders.

# Rules:
- Ignore all directories; don't change them
- Ignore all hidden files
- Ignore this Python script
- Generate directory names left based on the extensions of the files
- Move all files into their associated directory
